# Phoenix Stop Tracker


## How to run
This app was written in Node.JS. It is dependent on [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) being installed on your system.

To run the program, run the following command in the project's root directory: 
`npm run start /path/to/input /path/to/output`

For example: `npm run start ./sample.json ./output.json`

## Code I Wrote
The following files include code that I have written
1) `index.js`
2) `JSONStreamReader.js`

All other files are automatically generated by Node.

## Thought Process
My steps for solving this were as follows:
1. Build a class for streaming JSON objects from a file.
2. Start recording each vessel as they stream in, and find a way to be able to quickly check if one already has been seen before
3. Find an implementation for the haversine formula.
4. Calculate the speed of each vessel as new entries stream in
5. Save any vessels and their locations if they are stopped for an hour or more
6. Export as GeoJSON.
a. Test using [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/), looking for any vessel repeating in the same area, or any vessels on land
7. Take in command line arguments for input and output filepaths
